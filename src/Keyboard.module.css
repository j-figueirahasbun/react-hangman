mainly the reason we are using css for this and not react. You cant do these in react without writing javascript! */

/*  so then in keyboard.tsx you add both classes to the buttons, so inactive and active as well 
because they could be both this is done by adding ${styles.btn} ${styles.inactive} for example*/
